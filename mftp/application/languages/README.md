Monsta FTP is not responsible for the maintenance of language files (except English language files.)

# Create a new language file

To create a new language file please copy exactly the contents of the file: en_us.json

You must include your name and email address as the original author in the header.

We use ISO 639-1 language codes and the language's locality.

So for example, English as written in the United Kingdom would be "en_uk.json"
